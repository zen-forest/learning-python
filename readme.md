# Learning Python

I've decided to switch from Ruby to Python. Don't get me wrong, I love Ruby. My new employer uses Python and JavaScript, and well, I'm putting off JS as much as possible. 

One aspect that was missing from Ruby that I'm excited about with Python is applications with running things like Stable Diffusion or the ability to do more data-analytics related work. 

More to come!
